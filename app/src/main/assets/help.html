<p><strong>How to filter contacts</strong></p>
  <p>Before scrolling through your contacts, you can filter whole list so you don't have   to scroll through all your contacts. If you ever used T9 dialer, its   exactly like that except that each Pebble button represents one row of   T9 dialer buttons.<br>
    <br>
    Imagine you are entering name of the contact   on the regular keyboard. Its the same except that on the Pebble you only   have 3 buttons intead of 100 or so on the regular keyboard. That is why   each button corresponds to multiple characters (for example if you want   to enter either A or D, you need to press UP key in both cases). <br>
    <br>
    Buttons correspond to following characters:<br>
    <br>
    UP Button - abcdef0123 (this button also corresponds to symbols and any other characters not covered by following two buttons)<br>
    SELECT Button - ghijklmno456<br>
    DOWN Button - pqrstuvwxyz789<br>
    <br>
    So if you want to dial "Michael", you would press SELECT, SELECT, UP, SELECT, UP, UP, SELECT.<br>
    <br>
    You   may stop filtering whenever you want (preferably when wanted contact   appears on the screen). You may also continue to enter contact's last   name (spaces are ignored, so just keep entering letters) or you can even start with its last name.<br>
    <br>
    After you are done with filtering, long press SELECT button.

 <p><strong>I still get regular Pebble caller menu instead of PebbleDialer one</strong></p>
 <p>You must turn off&nbsp;call notification in settings</p>
  <p><strong>Call answering / declining or microphone mute is not working for me</strong></p>
 <p>If you are rooted, try enabling Root Mode. It should make those functions work.</p>
